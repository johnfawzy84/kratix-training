# Kratix Basic Training and Workshop

Welcome to the Kratix Orchestrator workshop! ðŸš€  
This hands-on session will guide you through the essential steps to set up, configure, and understand the Kratix platformâ€”an open-source framework for building powerful, flexible, and scalable platforms on Kubernetes.

Throughout this workshop, you will:

- **Learn about the prerequisites** for running Kratix, including user and tool setup.
- **Experience automated environment preparation**, where the system installs [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), creates a dedicated `kratixuser`, and ensures all required CLI tools are available.
- **Deploy and configure Kratix** on a Kubernetes cluster, including installing supporting components like [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) and [MinIO](https://min.io/).
- **Set up GitOps workflows** using [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) to automate resource management.
- **Understand the motivations and best practices** behind each step, empowering you to apply these concepts in your own environments.

> **Note:**  
> The environment uses a single Kubernetes cluster acting as both the platform and worker cluster for simplicity and speed. All setup steps are automated for you, so you can focus on learning and experimenting with Kratix itself.
