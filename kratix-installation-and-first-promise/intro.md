# Kratix Basic Training and Workshop

Welcome to the Kratix Orchestrator workshop! ðŸš€  
This Kratix training and workshop inspired by [Kratix workshop itself](https://docs.kratix.io/workshop/intro)
This hands-on session will guide you through the essential steps to set up, configure, and understand the Kratix platformâ€”an open-source framework for building powerful, flexible, and scalable platforms on Kubernetes, to be able to provide anything-as-a-service.

Throughout this workshop, you will:

- **Learn about the prerequisites** for running Kratix, including user and tool setup.
- **Experience automated environment preparation**, it is mostly automated for you, including all the needed tools to setup 2 cluster (Platform and Worker cluster, but we combined them in one)
- **Deploy and configure Kratix** on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Set up GitOps workflows in the worker cluster** using [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) to automate resource management.
- **install your first promise** and try to create an instance out of it. 
- **Understand the motivations and best practices** behind each step, empowering you to apply these concepts in your own environments.

> **Note:**  
> The environment uses a single Kubernetes cluster acting as both the platform and worker cluster for simplicity and speed. All setup steps are automated for you, so you can focus on learning and experimenting with Kratix itself.

Get ready to dive into the world of platform engineering with Kratix!
